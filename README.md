3-Servo Jointed Robot Leg
This project provides the 3D design files and instructions for a highly customizable 3-servo jointed robot leg. The modular design allows for easy adjustments to the leg length, joint angles, and servo mounting, making it a versatile starting point for building legged robots.
# key features:
## Joint Configuration:
The arrangement and positioning of the six servo motors are crucial to achieving the desired range of motion and stability for the robot leg. The design process involves carefully determining the optimal configuration of the joints to ensure the leg can move and support the robot's weight effectively.
## Mechanical design :
The 3D modeling and design of the joint components and connecting elements are critical to ensuring the overall robustness and lightweight construction of the robot leg. The design files provided in this project include meticulously crafted 3D models that have been optimized for 3D printing or other manufacturing processes, allowing for the creation of a durable and efficient leg structure.

The following images illustrates the design and configuration of the robot's leg joints with the six servo motors:
